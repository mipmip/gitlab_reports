# Gitlab Reports

Gitlab reports is a CLI utility that helps you creating reports from gitlab. It
uses yml-confiration files for report configuration and ERB-templates for
creating a report lay-out.

## Installation

Install the executable with:

    gem install gitlab_reports

Add a new access key in Gitlab. [Check this video how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmVBuNWMYY&feature=youtu.be)

Create main config file:

    echo "---" > $HOME/.gitlab_reports.yml
    echo "---" >> $HOME/.gitlab_reports.yml
    # Paste your token in de command below
    echo "TOKEN: [YOUR NEW TOKEN]" >> $HOME/.gitlab_reports.yml
    # Enter your local gitlab-url + /api/v4
    echo "ENDPOINT: https://your-gitlab.url/api/v4" >> $HOME/.gitlab_reports.yml

## Usage

Create a report-confirguration in YAML, save it anywhere you like.

It looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: Betaalde Issues uitvoeren
subtitle: Issues met impacts akkoord per project (uitvoeren)
filename: ~/Desktop/impacts-akkoord.md
columns:
  - iid
  - title
  - assignee
  - labels
project_ids:
  - 556 # comment this is project x, it will be included in the report
  - 555 # this is project y, idem dito
labels_include: feature|bug # seperate labels with | (pipe)
labels_exclude: please\ close|invalid:.* # regex is allowed
template: /path/to/template/issues-per-project.md.erb # html-templates are alow possible
```

Create a report-template as ERB, save it anywhere you like, refer to it in your report-configuration

Here's an example:

```
# <%= @title  %>

<% @proj.each do | prj | %>
## <%=prj['name']%>
<%=prj['issue_table']%>
<% end %>
```
